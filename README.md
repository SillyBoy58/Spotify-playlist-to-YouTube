100% FREE YouTube -> Spotify Playlist Transfer Tool
*(One-way only. No support for other platforms.)*

PROS:

100% ACCURATE: Uses ISRC codes* to match tracks precisely (local songs may vary).

NO LIMITS: Everything runs locally on your system, no usage caps.

NO FEES OR SUBSCRIPTIONS: Self-hosted, so there's nothing to pay.

NO SPOTIFY LOGINS REQUIRED: Transfers from public playlists only, so your account credentials stay private.

CONS:

No music videos: Transfers typically link to audio tracks, not official music videos.

Public playlists only: The YouTube playlist must be public during transfer (you can change it back afterward).

Does require a YouTube log-in as it is impossible to create playlists on your account without logging in

Spotify Dev Setup Required: Youâ€™ll need to create your own Spotify Developer App to avoid rate limits.

ISRC (International Standard Recording Code):
This is a unique identifier used by music distributors (like DistroKid, Vevo, etc.) when uploading tracks. It allows accurate cross-platform identification of songs - YouTube and Spotify included - by matching this metadata.
