CONS:
    No music videos: Transfers typically link to audio tracks, not official music videos.
    Public playlists only: The Spotify playlist must be public during transfer (you can change it back afterward).
    Requires a YouTube log-in as it is impossible to create playlists on your account without proper access.
    Spotify Dev & YouTube Data API Setup Required: Youâ€™ll need to create your own Spotify Developer App & YouTube Data API to avoid rate limits.

REQUIREMENTS:
    1. A YouTube account and a Spotify account with a playlist (obviously),
    2. Spotify Developer App ([Tutorial](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api))
    3. YouTube Data API ([Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)) Or use my short-hand version (because I found the UX to be terrible when following the official tutorial):
        3.1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com)
        3.2. Create a new project (or use an existing one)
        3.3. Enable the YouTube Data API v3
        3.4. Go to APIs & Services > Credentials
        3.5. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID (choose Desktop App)
        3.6. Download the client_secret_XXX.json file
        3.7. Rename it to YouTube_client_info.json
        3.8. Place it in the same directory as 'main.py'
        3.9. Make sure to add the google account (from which you will be transfering the YouTube playlist) to the Test users list (which is in APIs & Services > Credentials > OAuth 2.0 Client IDs > Audience > Test users > + Add users > Type in the gmail)
    4. All of the required Python libraries installed (pip install <library>)

ðŸŸ¥ !!!! DO NOT SHARE YOUR "token.json", "Spotify_client_info.json" or "YouTube_client_info.json" UNLESS YOU 100% TRUST THE PERSON YOURE SENDING IT TO !!!! ðŸŸ¥
